# HCL Conversion

This project was created to enable reading HCL configuration files to be used by other tools.

For example, I would like to pass configuration from a Terraform tfvars file and use them in ansible.

### Using

Example:

`./hcl-configuration example.tfvars`

With ansible

``ansible-playbook playbook.yml --extra-vars "`$HCLC_PATH/hcl-conversion ~/.terraform/example.tfvars`"``

### Building

``dep ensure``

``go build -ldflags "-X main.GitCommit `git rev-parse HEAD`"``

### Testing

```shell
$ go test ./...
```

### Issues

When testing

`cannot find package "github.com/stretchr/testify/assert" in any of: ...`

You will need to

```shell
$ go get github.com/stretchr/testify/assert
```
